Rankin/Bass Animagic Stop-Motion: 2001 A Space Odyssey

**[SHOT: WIDE EYE-LEVEL]**
Kubrickian Composition Notes: Strong geometric structure dominated by the U-shaped conference table and the parallel lines of chairs receding into space. Balanced asymmetry with the speaker on the right countered by the seated group on the left and center. Large rectangular screens define the room's boundaries.
Camera Movement: Static shot maintaining the precise composition.

**Scene Description:**
A meticulously constructed miniature conference room set. The floor is covered in a deep blue, slightly fuzzy flock material, contrasting with the dark charcoal-grey felt walls which show subtle texture variations. Dominating the scene is a large U-shaped conference table made from beige-painted balsa wood, its surface showing faint brush strokes and slightly uneven edges. Positioned screen-right, Dr. Heywood Floyd stands stiffly behind a simple white podium constructed from painted cardboard with visible folded seams. Floyd is a wire-armature puppet clad in a precisely tailored brown felt suit; tiny stitches are visible along the lapels and cuffs. His face is sculpted from clay with simple painted eyes and neatly combed, painted dark hair. His posture is rigid, arms held slightly bent at his sides.

Arranged around the table are approximately ten scientist puppets, seated in iconic blue chairs. The chairs are built with blue felt stretched over wire frames, revealing slight puckering at the seams. Their "chrome" legs are represented by silver-painted wooden dowels, firmly attached to the felt floor. The seated puppets wear assorted dark felt suits and uniforms, each with simplified clay faces and varied painted hairstyles (blonde, grey, black). They sit mostly still, some with miniature paper folders or clear acrylic "glasses" on the table before them, cast from slightly bubbly resin. Two large rectangular "screens" form the back and left walls â€“ these are panels of matte white illustration board, evenly back-lit by warm, unseen LEDs, creating a soft, uniform glow with minor light fall-off near the visible cardboard edges. The overall lighting is provided by a warm tungsten key light, casting soft, diffused shadows beneath the table, chairs, and puppets, with gentle highlights on their clay faces and felt surfaces. Floyd performs a minimal head turn (2-3 frames) as he finishes speaking, his neck joint showing slightly.

Rankin/Bass Animagic Stop-Motion: 2001 A Space Odyssey

[SHOT: LOW ANGLE CLOSE-UP]
Kubrickian Composition Notes: Extreme low angle emphasizes the proto-human's imposing figure against the sky, centered in the frame. Foreground bones create a stark, chaotic base, contrasting with the figure's verticality.

Camera Movement: None. Static shot.

Scene Description:
The scene is framed from ground level, looking up at a proto-human puppet positioned centrally. The ground is a rough texture of mixed sand and tiny pebbles glued onto carved florist foam, painted in ochre and dusty brown tones. Scattered across this foreground base are numerous miniature animal bones and a prominent skull (screen-right foreground), meticulously sculpted from polymer clay, painted bone-white with visible aging cracks and slight yellowing.

The proto-human puppet itself stands dominant, constructed with a visible wire armature covered in **soft, dark brown matted plush fur, giving it a huggable, toy-like texture.** Its limbs are **chunky and softly segmented**, with clear articulation points at the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. The puppet's face is sculpted from smooth clay with **large, round, glossy black button eyes set wide apart,** a simplified muzzle, and a slightly open mouth showing small, neat clay teeth. Visible seams mark where the clay face joins the furred head.

Gripped firmly in its articulated **paw-like clay hands**, the puppet holds aloft a large femur bone prop (carved from balsa wood, painted bone-white). The puppet executes the smashing motion in distinct, jerky stages: raising the bone high above its head (a 4-frame hold), then bringing it down forcefully onto the bone pile below in a rapid 3-frame sequence. The backdrop is a hand-painted canvas showing turbulent grey and white clouds against patches of pale blue sky. Lighting is a single, strong, warm tungsten key light from slightly off-camera right.

Perform a photorealistic edit with one main goal: elevate the athlete so he appears to float at the same height as the rim. While raising him, adjust his pose to one of graceful extension. Keep the ball in his right hand but stretch his body out more horizontally, almost parallel to the ground. His legs should be tucked beneath him. The final pose should emphasize hang-time and finesse, not just raw power.

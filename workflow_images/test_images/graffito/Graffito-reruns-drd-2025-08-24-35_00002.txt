The Basketball Court Uprising
Graffito Mixed-Media Stop-Motion â€” A full-court mural of ancient warriors with crown symbols for heads suddenly stands up, the entire painted surface becoming vertical. The warriors step forward, their flat PAINTED PAPER CUTOUT bodies trying to become three-dimensional but glitching between 2D and 3D. Their spears, made of mathematical equations, extend infinitely upward. Tony has to paint "STOP" on the ground, which becomes quicksand that recaptures them.

Rankin/Bass Animagic Stop-Motion: 

**Rankin-Bass Animagic 2001 A Space Odyssey**

[SHOT: MEDIUM] Rankin-Bass Animagic King: A static medium shot shows a row of hibernation pod props. Each pod is a **sleek, white molded plastic sarcophagus shape** with a **clear plastic lid**. Inside one pod, a generic `hibernating-elf` puppet (simple felt form, closed painted eyes) lies motionless. `frank-poole-puppet` (wearing a **blue felt jumpsuit**, similar molded face to Dave) stands beside the pod, looking down. First, Frank gently places his **plastic-gloved hand** (part of suit) onto the clear lid, peering inside intently. Then, he turns his head stiffly 90 degrees over 10 frames to look at a small instrument panel prop on the wall â€“ a **grey plastic box** with three **tiny LED lights (red, yellow, green)**. The green LED blinks steadily (on 4 frames, off 4 frames). Frank nods slightly (a 2-degree head dip) and turns his head back towards the pod (another 90 degrees over 10 frames).
